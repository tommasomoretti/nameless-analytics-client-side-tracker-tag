## Event data
### Event name
Choose between standard event names or custom event names. 

Please note:
- <u>Always trigger a `page_view` event as the very first event on every page load.</u> </br>
  **Any event triggered before a `page_view` will be rejected.**
- Use standard event names whenever possible.
- Follow naming conventions for event names and event parameters.

#### Standard event name
Choose a standard event name for the event:

* page_view: Send this event when a page is viewed. Use this event for both standard and virtual page views. This is the only mandatory event.
* consent_given: Send this event when the user gives consent to improve the accuracy of consent metrics.
* page_load_time: Send this event when a page is loaded (on the `gtm.load` JavaScript event) with these parameters:
  * time_to_dom_interactive: `performance.timing.domInteractive - performance.timing.responseStart`
  * page_render_time: `performance.timing.domComplete - performance.timing.domLoading`
  * time_to_dom_complete: `performance.timing.domComplete - performance.timing.responseStart`
  * total_page_load_time: `performance.timing.loadEventEnd - performance.timing.navigationStart` 
* page_closed: Send this event when a page is closed to improve the accuracy of `time_on_page`, `session_duration`, and other metrics.

#### Custom event name
Choose a custom event name for the event.

To maintain consistency between events, it is highly recommended to use _snake_case_ notation style (with underscores between words) to create descriptive, easily interpretable names. 

Examples:
* button_clicked
* form_submitted
* video_played

Avoid
* Spaces: button clicked
* Hyphens: button-clicked
* CamelCase: ButtonClicked


### Event parameters
Add event parameters for a specific event. The parameters will be added in the event_data object in the payload. 

Please note: if a parameter has the same name as another, it can override or be overridden depending on where it was set.

This is the hierarchy of event parameter importance: 

See [Parameter Hierarchy & Overriding](https://github.com/nameless-analytics/nameless-analytics/#parameter-hierarchy--overriding) in the main project documentation.

#### Add/override event level parameters
Add or overwrite parameters for a specific event. Accepted values: strings, integers, floats, and JSON. The `page_id` and `event_id` parameters cannot be overwritten.

These parameters can override:
- default event parameters
- dataLayer event parameters added in Nameless Analytics Client-side Tracker Tag
- shared event parameters added in Nameless Analytics Client-side Tracker Configuration Variable

These parameters can be overridden by:
- event parameter added in Nameless Analytics Server-side Client Tag

#### Remove event level parameters
Remove event level parameters in event_data object in the payload.

#### Add event parameters from dataLayer
Retrieve current dataLayer values from the dataLayer.push() event that triggered the tag.

These parameters can override:
- default event parameters

These parameters can be overridden by:
- shared event parameters added in Nameless Analytics Client-side Tracker Configuration Variable
- event parameters added in Nameless Analytics Client-side Tracker Tag
- event parameters added in Nameless Analytics Server-side Client Tag

## Configuration variable settings
### Configuration Variable
The Nameless Analytics Client-side Tracker Tag inherits configuration settings from [Nameless Analytics Client-side Tracker Configuration Variable](https://github.com/nameless-analytics/nameless-analytics-client-side-tracker-configuration-variable/). 

This variable will handle settings like:
- [set requests endpoint domain name and path](https://github.com/nameless-analytics/nameless-analytics-client-side-tracker-configuration-variable/#server-side-endpoint-settings)
- [set user level parameters](https://github.com/nameless-analytics/nameless-analytics-client-side-tracker-configuration-variable/#user-parameters)
- [set session level parameters](https://github.com/nameless-analytics/nameless-analytics-client-side-tracker-configuration-variable/#session-parameters)
- [set common event parameters](https://github.com/nameless-analytics/nameless-analytics-client-side-tracker-configuration-variable/#event-parameters)
- [respect Google Consent Mode](https://github.com/nameless-analytics/nameless-analytics-client-side-tracker-configuration-variable/#respect-google-consent-mode)
- [enable cross-domain tracking](https://github.com/nameless-analytics/nameless-analytics-client-side-tracker-configuration-variable/#enable-cross-domain-tracking)
- [customize source and campaigns URL parameters](https://github.com/nameless-analytics/nameless-analytics-client-side-tracker-configuration-variable/#override-default-source-and-campaigns-url-query-parameters)
- [change default JavaScript page view event names](https://github.com/nameless-analytics/nameless-analytics-client-side-tracker-configuration-variable/#override-default-javascript-page-view-event-names)
- [load main library from custom location](https://github.com/nameless-analytics/nameless-analytics-client-side-tracker-configuration-variable/#load-javascript-libraries-in-first-party-mode)
- [add current dataLayer state](https://github.com/nameless-analytics/nameless-analytics-client-side-tracker-configuration-variable/#add-current-datalayer-state)
- [show logs in JavaScript console](https://github.com/nameless-analytics/nameless-analytics-client-side-tracker-configuration-variable/#enable-logs-in-javascript-console)

</br></br>



## Advanced settings
### Add ecommerce data from dataLayer
Add ecommerce data as a JSON object inside the ecommerce field.

Please note: 
- By default, the table function queries extract data from standard GA4 ecommerce data structure
- The data model can be customized to support any ecommerce data structure by modifying the relative JSON paths in the user, session, ecommerce, product and funnels table function queries

To add ecommerce data, create a tag with {{Event}} as [custom event name](#custom-event-name) and a trigger that matches all ecommerce event names: 

* view_promotion
* select_promotion
* view_item_list
* select_item
* view_item
* add_to_wishlist
* add_to_cart
* remove_from_cart
* view_cart
* begin_checkout
* add_shipping_info
* add_payment_info
* purchase
* refund

Push ecommerce data into the dataLayer as follows:

```javascript
dataLayer.push({ ecommerce: null });
dataLayer.push({
  event: "purchase",
  ecommerce: {
    // Ecommerce data
  }
});
```


### Disable logs in JavaScript console for this event
Disable console log for this specific event when [Enable logs in JavaScript console](https://github.com/nameless-analytics/nameless-analytics-client-side-tracker-configuration-variable/#enable-logs-in-javascript-console) is enabled in the Nameless Analytics Client-side Tracker Configuration Variable. 

</br></br>



## Execution messages
### Success messages
When logs are enabled, the following success and status messages may appear in the browser console:

| **Scope** | **Message** | **Description** |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Config | `[event_name] > 🟢 Valid Nameless Analytics Client-Side tracker configuration variable` | Tag configuration variable is correctly set and verified |
| | `[event_name] > 🟢 UA parser library loaded from: [URL]` | The User-Agent parser library was successfully injected and loaded |
| | `[event_name] > 🟢 Main library loaded from: [URL]` | The Nameless Analytics core library was successfully injected and loaded |
| Consent | `[event_name] > 🟢 analytics_storage granted` | Tracking is allowed by Google Consent Mode |
| Events | `[event_name] > 🟢 Valid [event_name]` | The event was successfully built and validated |
| | `[event_name] > 🟢 Request claimed successfully` | The event was successfully sent to the server-side endpoint |
| Cross-domain | `cross-domain > 🟢 Valid user data. Cross-domain URL link decoration will be applied` | Success log for `na_id` link decoration |

### Error messages
These messages appear in the browser console when an issue prevents the correct execution of the tag:

| **Scope** | **Message** | **What it means** | **How to fix it** |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| Config | `[event_name] > 🔴 Tracker configuration error: event has invalid Nameless Analytics Client-Side tracker configuration variable` | The tag is missing the required config variable or it's incorrectly set | Check the "Configuration Variable" field in the tag and ensure it points to a valid NA Config Variable |
| | `[event_name] > 🔴 Main library not loaded from: [URL]` | The browser couldn't fetch the core tracker script | Verify the URL in the Config Variable or check your network/CORS settings |
| | `[event_name] > 🔴 UA parser library not loaded from: [URL]` | The browser couldn't fetch the User-Agent parser script | Verify the library URL or check for ad-blockers/firewalls |
| | `[event_name] > 🔴 Permission denied: unable to load Main library from [URL]` | The GTM Sandbox is blocking the external script loading | Ensure the library URL is added to the "Inject Scripts" permission in the template |
| | `[event_name] > 🔴 Permission denied: unable to load UA parser library from [URL]` | The GTM Sandbox is blocking the external script loading | Ensure the library URL is added to the "Inject Scripts" permission in the template |
| Consent | `[event_name] > 🔴 Google Consent Mode not found` | The tag expects GCM to be active, but it's not initialized on the page | Ensure GCM is correctly implemented on the site before GTM loads |
| | `[event_name] > 🔴 analytics_storage denied` | Tracking is blocked by Google Consent Mode | This is expected behavior for users who opt-out. No action needed unless it's blocking your own tests |
| Events | `[event_name] > 🔴 Request aborted` | A generic issue (like missing libraries or denied consent) stopped the tag execution | Check the previous logs in the console to find the specific cause |
| | `[event_name] > 🔴 [event_name] fired on wrong event: [name]` | The trigger is firing the tag on an unexpected GTM event | Adjust the tag trigger to match the intended event (e.g., use `gtm.js` for page_view) |
| | `[event_name] > 🔴 Event fired before a page view event. The first event on a page view ever must be page_view. Request aborted` | Sequence error: an event was triggered before a `page_view` initialized the session | Reorder your triggers to ensure `page_view` always fires first |
| | `[event_name] > 🔴 Request refused` | The server rejected the request | Check the server-side tag logs for more details |
| | `[event_name] > 🔴 This website is not authorized to send Nameless Analytics requests` | The calling domain is not in the server-side authorized list | Add your domain to the "Authorized domains" list in the Server-side Client Tag |
| | `[event_name] > 🔴 Error while fetch: [URL]` | The fetch request to the server-side endpoint failed | Check server logs, endpoint URL correctness, and CORS settings |
| Cross-domain | `cross-domain > 🔴 Invalid user data. No cross-domain URL link decoration will be applied` | Data required for link decoration (na_id) is missing or invalid | Ensure `page_view` has fired successfully and cookies are correctly set |
| | `cross-domain > 🔴 Error while fetch user data: [error]` | The cross-domain listener failed to retrieve IDs from the server | Verify the server-side client is reachable and not returning errors |
